# Professional Startup/Shutdown System - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### What Was Implemented:

1. **Configuration-based startup** - Backend now opens frontends based on config settings
2. **Coordinated shutdown** - Frontend can gracefully shut down the backend 
3. **Professional UX** - Confirmation dialog for exit operations
4. **Graceful lifecycle management** - Proper cleanup of resources

### Key Components Added:

#### Backend Changes:
- **Lifecycle Manager** (`pkg/lifecycle/manager.go`) - Manages application lifecycle
- **Shutdown Topic** (`pkg/broker/topics/lifecycle/shutdown.go`) - WebSocket topic for shutdown requests
- **Updated WebSocket Pool** - Tracks client connections for graceful shutdown
- **Enhanced Configuration** - New app settings for startup/shutdown behavior
- **Updated main.go** - Integrated lifecycle management and configuration-based browser opening

#### Frontend Changes:
- **Exit Confirmation Dialog** - Professional confirmation modal using project's design system
- **Shutdown Handling** - Browser event handling for coordinated shutdown
- **Updated HandlerMessages** - Added lifecycle message types to WebSocket interface

### Configuration Options:

```toml
[app]
# Which frontend to open automatically on backend start
# Options: "control-station", "ethernet-view", "both", "none"
automatic_window_opening = "control-station"

# Shutdown behavior
# Options: "coordinated" (frontend controls backend), "independent" (legacy behavior)  
shutdown_mode = "coordinated"

# Grace period for shutdown in milliseconds
shutdown_grace_period = 5000
```

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend/cmd
   ./backend
   ```
   - Verify only control-station opens (based on config)
   - Check logs show "opening control-station"

2. **Test Configuration:**
   - Edit `config.toml` and change `automatic_window_opening` to "both"
   - Restart backend and verify both frontends open

3. **Test Coordinated Shutdown:**
   - Try closing the browser tab
   - Verify confirmation dialog appears
   - Click "Cancel" - should keep running
   - Click "Exit Control Station" - backend should shut down gracefully

4. **Test WebSocket Error Handling:**
   - Stop backend while frontend is running
   - Verify exit confirmation dialog appears
   - Click "Cancel" to reload and reconnect

5. **Test Independent Mode:**
   - Set `shutdown_mode = "independent"` in config
   - Restart backend
   - Close browser tab - should not trigger shutdown

### Expected Behavior:

‚úÖ **Professional startup experience**
- Only configured frontends open
- Clear logging of actions
- Configurable behavior

‚úÖ **Coordinated shutdown**
- Browser close triggers confirmation
- Graceful backend shutdown
- Proper resource cleanup
- 5-second grace period for client disconnection

‚úÖ **Improved UX**
- No surprise shutdowns
- Clear exit confirmation
- Professional dialog design
- Escape key support

## üîß Configuration Examples

### Development Setup (open both frontends):
```toml
[app]
automatic_window_opening = "both"
shutdown_mode = "coordinated"
shutdown_grace_period = 3000
```

### Production Setup (control-station only):
```toml
[app]
automatic_window_opening = "control-station"
shutdown_mode = "coordinated"
shutdown_grace_period = 10000
```

### Legacy Behavior:
```toml
[app]
automatic_window_opening = "both"
shutdown_mode = "independent"
shutdown_grace_period = 5000
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **No more surprise multiple windows** - Configurable startup behavior
2. **Professional shutdown experience** - Confirmation dialog prevents accidental exits
3. **Graceful resource cleanup** - Backend shuts down properly when frontend closes
4. **Better development workflow** - Configure for your preferred setup
5. **Backwards compatible** - Independent mode preserves legacy behavior

## üîç Technical Details

### WebSocket Flow:
1. Frontend sends `lifecycle/shutdown` message with reason
2. Backend acknowledges with `lifecycle/shutdownResponse`
3. Backend triggers graceful shutdown with registered handlers
4. Client connections are tracked and waited for during shutdown

### Error Handling:
- WebSocket errors trigger exit confirmation
- Network disconnection shows reconnection option
- Escape key cancels confirmation dialog
- Invalid shutdown requests are rejected

The system is now production-ready with professional startup and shutdown behavior!
